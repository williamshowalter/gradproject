        <h2>Wizard</h2>
        <b>Internet Connection Setup Wizard</b> - This page is used to set up the %%ModelName();%% using the Wizard to walk you 
        through setting up the camera for your network. This can be done manually using the static IP, automatically 
        using the DHCP client (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is a networking protocol that will allow leasing 
        of an IP address by the client from a server for a specified amount of time.) or PPPoE.<br><br>
        <b>PPPoE</b> -  (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet) If you use the %%ModelName();%% to connect directly to the 
        Internet you will need to put in the user name and password that was given to you when you set up your account with 
        the Internet Service Provider in these fields.<br><br>
        <b>DDNS</b> - (Dynamic Domain Name Server) If you have set up the DDNS service you will need to put in your 
        user name and password in these fields if your %%ModelName();%% is using a public IP Address. This will allow the DDNS 
        to track your IP Address even if it changes. 
      </div><br>
      <div class="box">
        <a NAME="Network"></a>
        <h2>Network Setup</h2>
        <b>LAN Settings</b> -  This can be done manually by entering a fixed IP address or automatically using the DHCP Client (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is a networking protocol that will allow leasing of an IP address by the client from a server for a specified amount of time) or PPPoE.<br><br>
        <b>PPPoE(Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet)</b> - If you use the %%ModelName();%% to connect directly to the Internet, you will need to enter the valid user name and password that are provided by your Internet Service Provider.<br><br>
        <b>DNS</b> (Domain Name System) server is an Internet service that translates domain names (i.e. www.dlink.com) into IP addresses (i.e. 192.168.0.20). The DNS IP address can be received from your ISP.<br><br>
        <b>Port Settings</b> - Most ISPs do not open port 80 (a %%ModelName();%% default video transfer port) for their residential customers, the %%ModelName();%% has the ability to use a different port by enabling the second http port for its video streaming. Any unused ports can be used such as port 800, 801, etc. Remember that if the %%ModelName();%% is behind a router, you will need to forward that port to the %%ModelName();%%'s IP Address. When accessing the camera, you would need to type the camera's IP Address followed by the colon character and the port number (for example http://192.168.0.20:800).<br><br>
        <b>UPnP Settings</b> - UPnP is short for Universal Plug and Play, which is a networking architecture that provides compatibility among networking equipment, software, and peripherals. The %%ModelName();%% is an UPnP enabled Internet camera that will work with other UPnP devices. This function is enabled by default. If you do not want to use this feature, you may disable it by selecting <b>Disabled</b>.<br><br>
        <b>UPnP port forwarding</b> - UPnP port forwarding will allow an IP camera to communicate with an UPnP compatible network router for simplified local network device access as well as remote access via the Internet. In order to allow UPnP port forwarding you will first need to ensure that UPnP is supported and enabled on your router. Once this has been confirmed you will then need to enable UPnP port forwarding on your IP camera. If the default ports used are free for port forwarding, you can use those. Otherwise, you will need to change the HTTP ports that are in use to allow for proper UPnP port forwarding. After the proper network ports have been assigned to your IP camera, you should then be able to access your IP camera over the Internet. <br><br>
        <b>Bonjour</b> - If enabled, the camera is accessible through a Bonjour-enabled browser, such as the Apple Mac Safari browser.<br><br>
        <b>Bonjour Name</b> - Enter the name of your camera here. This is the name the Bonjour service will display.
